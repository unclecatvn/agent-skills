description: >
  Odoo 18 development reference for Python models and ORM (search, domain, read_group, compute fields),
  XML/CSV data and views, OWL/JS client code, QWeb reports, security (ACL, record rules, groups),
  cron and server actions, migrations and module upgrades, tests, i18n, and performance.
  Use this skill whenever work involves Odoo 18 or custom addons—even if the user only pastes a traceback,
  mentions addons/ or __manifest__.py, describes form/list/kanban/XML errors, HTTP controllers, or
  business rules on models—including building features, fixing bugs, refactoring, or reviewing addon code.
  Includes CSS/SCSS asset authoring and review for Odoo addons.

## Coding Conventions

Apply the convention section in the guide you open. Odoo 18 runtime behavior,
then existing stable-addon style, takes precedence; keep diffs focused.

- Module naming, assets, JavaScript, CSS, and SCSS: development guide.
- XML formatting and IDs: data, actions, reports, security, and views guides.
- Python, recordsets, transactions, and translations: model, field, decorator,
  performance, transaction, and translation guides.
